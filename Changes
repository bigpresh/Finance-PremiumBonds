0.06  2012-09-07
    - Updates to handle changes in the NS&I website, and fix a typo in the error

    - Oh dear.  Somehow, I released this module with a syntax error in.
      Not sure how I managed that.  I'm sure I checked it, but clearly
      not.  Just as well nobody else uses this ;)

0.04  2009-01-05
    - Remove silly left-in debugging aid which outputted the HTML we got
      from the NS+I website to STDERR (heh, I guess nobody uses this
      module, since nobody complained!)
