NAME
    Finance::PremiumBonds - Perl extension to check Premium Bond holder's
    numbers

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::PremiumBonds;
  
      if (defined(my $won = Finance::PremiumBonds::has_won($holder_number))) 
      {
          print "Looks like you " . ($won)? 'may have won' : 'have not won';
      } else {
          warn "An error occurred.";
      }
  
DESCRIPTION
    Quick way to look up a Premium Bond holder's number on the National
    Savings and Investments website to determine whether the holder has won
    any prizes recently.

    Currently I don't have a list of possible responses to look for (and
    they could change at any time anyway) so the module will return true if
    it receives a non-error response which doesn't include the recognised
    negative response text. If it ever reports incorrect results to you,
    please do let me know so I can update it.

FUNCTIONS
    has_won($holder_number)
        Checks whether $holder_number has won any prizes recently. Returns 1
        if it looks like you've won, 0 if you haven't, or undef if it failed
        to check.

LIMITATIONS
    Currently, the module detects lack of a recognised "losing" response
    rather than the presence of a winning response; without a holder's
    number which has won something, I can't see what the winning responses
    look like. Maybe my meagre Premium Bonds investment will win something
    one day, then I can update this module :)
