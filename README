NAME
    Finance::PremiumBonds - Perl extension to check Premium Bond holder's
    numbers

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::PremiumBonds;
  
      if (defined(my $won = Finance::PremiumBonds::has_won($holder_number))) 
      {
          print "Looks like you " . ($won)? 'may have won' : 'have not won';
      } else {
          warn "An error occurred.";
      }
  
DESCRIPTION
    Quick way to look up a Premium Bond holder's number on the National
    Savings and Investments website to determine whether the holder has won
    any prizes recently.

    Now uses the AJAX interface the NS&I site uses, which returns some JSON
    so we don't have to screen-scrape.

    I've never won anything, so I don't know what the win response looks
    like (if you have, please do help me by letting me know!), so it treats
    the absence of the no_win status in the response as a win - this means
    it's possible that it could falsely report positive if there are other
    statuses, e.g. "failed to check" or similar.

FUNCTIONS
    has_won($holder_number, $period)
        Checks whether $holder_number has won any prizes in the specified
        period. Returns 1 if it looks like you've won, 0 if you haven't, or
        undef if it failed to check.

        The period is any period recognised by the NS&I site - at the time
        of writing, that's `this_month', `last_six_month',
        `unclaimed_prize'. If it's not given, then `this_month' is used as a
        sensible default.

LIMITATIONS
    Currently, the module detects lack of a recognised "losing" response
    rather than the presence of a winning response; without a holder's
    number which has won something, I can't see what the winning responses
    look like. Maybe my meagre Premium Bonds investment will win something
    one day, then I can update this module :)
