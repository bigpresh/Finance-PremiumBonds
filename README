Finance::PremiumBonds README
===========================

A very simple module to look up a Premium Bond holder's number on the
National Savings and Investments website (www.nsandi.com) and determine
whether the holder's number has won a prize lately.

Currently I don't have a list of possible responses to look for (and they
could change at any time anyway) so the module will return true if it
receives a non-error response which doesn't include the recognised negative
response text.  If it ever reports incorrect results to you, please do
let me know so I can update it.
